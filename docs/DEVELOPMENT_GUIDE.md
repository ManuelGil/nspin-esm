## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v22+**: The project leverages modern Node.js features, such as `styleText` from `node:util` and `performance.now()`, which require Node.js version 22 or later.
- **npm v9+**: Recommended for proper dependency handling.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code or any preferred editor with TypeScript support.
- **Familiarity with TypeScript**: Since **nspin-esm** is written in TypeScript.

---

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManuelGil/nspin-esm.git
   cd nspin-esm
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Your Editor:**

   - For VSCode, ensure that the built-in TypeScript version is set to the workspace version.
   - Install recommended extensions like ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command uses [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to bundle the project in both ESM and CommonJS formats, generate type declarations, and create sourcemaps.

---

## Running Tests

The project uses Vitest for unit testing. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

Ensure that all tests pass before creating a pull request.

---

## Debugging and Linting

- **Debugging:**

  - Use your IDE's debugging tools (e.g., VSCode Debugger) to set breakpoints and inspect variables.
  - For command-line debugging, you can add `console.log` or `debugger` statements as needed.

- **Linting & Formatting:**

  - **Linting:** Run the linter with:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

  - **Formatting:** Format your code using Prettier:

    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```

---

## Development Workflow

- **Branching:**
  Create feature branches for new functionality or bug fixes.

- **Commits:**
  Follow Conventional Commits guidelines for clear, consistent commit messages.

- **Pull Requests:**
  Submit pull requests against the `develop` branch with detailed descriptions of your changes.

- **Code Reviews:**
  Expect constructive feedback; adhere to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
